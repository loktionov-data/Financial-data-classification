# Financial-data-classification
Making a model a classifying model on a financial dataset

---

## Features of the Project

### 1. **Data Cleaning**
- Removed unnecessary or redundant data entries.
- Filtered and standardized the dataset to improve model readiness.

### 2. **Data Encoding**
- Converted categorical text data into numerical formats using encoding techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- Ensured compatibility with the XGBoost model, which requires numeric inputs.

### 3. **Data Visualization**
- Created insightful visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships in the dataset.
- Plotted key financial metrics to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset and find some logical mistakes.

### 4. **Correlation Heatmap**
- Built a correlation matrix heatmap to analyze relationships between features.
- Identified highly correlated features to optimize the model and reduce multicollinearity.

### 5. **XGBoost Classification Model**
- Constructed and tuned an XGBoost classifier for the dataset.
- Evaluated the model using accuracy metrics
